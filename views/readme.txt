 This directory holds the html, that is going to be handled by the UI module, before
 passing it as a html.

 All of these files are the basic html files, that have special <$> tags inserted inside of them.
 Inside of these tags, the UI module is going to create the dynamic content.

 Things to be added are all dynamic content: Comments, images, amount of likes, friend lists and so forth.

 Files that are done:  (update as more gets done)
 clickedmedia.html
 index.html (add the script to add more content)
 myfotema.html
